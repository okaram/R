Saw the [Island of Games Puzzle](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/island-of-games-puzzle-problem-statement) and decided to try to analyze it. Downloaded the excel sheet, and savead as a CSV.


```{r}
i=read.table("IslandOfGamesData.txt", header=TRUE)
```

We know (from the problem) that variables do not appear correlated individually; let's try adding two of them ...

```{r}
plot(i$RCube,i$Chess+i$Checkers)
```

Hmm, the data looks very different when RCube is less than around 0.5 than when it is more; lets try

```{r}
plot(i$Chess[i$RCube>0.5],i$Checkers[i$RCube>0.5])
 plot(i$Chess[i$RCube<0.5],i$Checkers[i$RCube<0.5])
```

Cool. Now we see the relation.
